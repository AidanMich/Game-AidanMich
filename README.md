I have added the outline of my game here. It also has can be found on my website.

It is essentially a 2D medieval tower defense game, imagine something like bloons td 6 or a similiar type of game.

It will have multiple levels with different maps and paths and the enemies will follow a predetermined path and if they reach the end you lose.

To stop the enemies from reaching the end you will purchase towers and place them along the map off of the path and they will shoot the enemies.

Each tower will have different abilities and will be able to be upgraded.

I imagine this game have a singleplayer a co-op and a multiplayer.

I imagine that in the multiplayer you will be able to see the other persons map or maybe it will be partly covered by the fog of war!
Then you can send in enemies or debuffs to your opponenent.
